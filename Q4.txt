Kigali is the capital and largest city of Rwanda. 
It is near the nation's geographic centre in a region of rolling hills, 
with a series of valleys and ridges joined by steep slopes. 
The city has been Rwanda's economic, cultural, and
transport hub since it became the capital following independence from Belgium in 1962.
